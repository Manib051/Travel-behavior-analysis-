# Travel-behavior-analysis- Final Project

This project explores a travel booking dataset to uncover traveler behavior patterns and booking strategies.  
The goal is to provide actionable insights that can help a travel platform optimize its **marketing strategies, and user experience**.  

The analysis was performed in **Python using Jupyter Notebook** and focuses on questions such as:
- How do trip duration and number of cities visited vary by booker country?
- During which months is multi-city travel most and least popular?
- How do spontaneous booking rates differ by device class?
- Which destination combinations are most frequently booked together?
- Are there regional differences in travel behaviors (duration, complexity)?
- Which referral channels drive the highest-value bookings?

## Purpose
Understanding these patterns allows travel companies to:
- **Personalize recommendations** (e.g., multi-city itineraries for certain regions).
- **Improve marketing campaigns** (e.g., target mobile users with last-minute offers).
- **Support hospitality providers** (e.g., extended-stay deals for regions with long trips).
- **Identify high-value affiliates** driving longer bookings.
